For the first time in my life I've used bootstrap and it was annoying... The portfolio uses some of the bootstrap features...


# Portfolio Template


This is a very simple but amazing looking portfolio with a loader and a clean design.




## Features

- Light/dark mode toggle (Soon)
- Loader
- Clean Design
- No credits
- Amazing animations
- Responsive (I hope...)

## FAQ

#### Can I change anything?

You can change absolutely everything as I do not require credits.

#### Will you update this?

I will probably add more to it if the repository reaches 20+ stars.
